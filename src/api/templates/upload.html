        Hey there! Looks like you're looking forward to creating a new course on Everskill. To quote Wikipedia, "Thank you, and welcome".<br>
        You can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/n3rdium/everskill-course-template">n3rdium/everskill-course-template</a> to get started.<br>
        Once you've created it, open up a discussion on our GitHub repo mentioning the github repo: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/N3RDIUM/Everskill/discussions/new?category=course-addition-request">Course Addition Request</a><br>
        Once the community accepts your course, we will add it to the website. You will be given a ton of coins and gems as a reward for helping the community.<br>
